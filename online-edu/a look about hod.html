        <p>House of the Dragon is an American fantasy drama television series. An independent prequel to Game of Thrones (2011â€“2019), it is the second show in the franchise, created by George R. R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik are the showrunners. Based on parts of the novel Fire & Blood, the series is set about 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen, descendant of the eponymous royal house, and 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the beginning of the end of House Targaryen, the events leading up to and covering the Targaryen civil war of succession, known as the "Dance of the Dragons".

           
            House of the Dragon received a straight-to-series order in October 2019, with casting beginning in July 2020 and principal photography starting in April 2021 in the United Kingdom. The series premiered on August 21, 2022, with the first season consisting of ten episodes. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season. Sapochnik departed as showrunner after the first season, leaving Condal to serve as the sole showrunner for the second season. The first season received highly positive reviews, with praise towards its character development, writing, score, and performances (particularly Considine, Smith, D'Arcy, Alcock, and Cooke). However, the pacing, specifically of the time jumps, and the lighting of some scenes were criticized. The series premiere was watched by over 10 million viewers, the biggest in HBO's history.</p>
